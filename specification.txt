This cat sit service website is my first ever "handmade" website.
What has been used:
Tailwind, for general css. It's very intuitive, can't imagine how it's like to write with traditional css;
Tsparticles module, for click-sparkling effect;
Bootstrap, for navigation bar

Problem solve:
The collision of css class names between Bootstrap and Tailwind: using prefix tw-
The bug regarding Tsparticles module: using an older version module
